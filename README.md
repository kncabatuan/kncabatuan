# 👋 Hi, I'm Kevin

I'm a Civil Engineer hoping to transition to the field of tech, with a growing focus on anything AI-related. 

Gaming sparked my love for computers, which led me to explore software development. Right now, I am trying to learn programming from scratch and I decided to start with Python.

Currently sharing my very first personal project **EZ Youtube Downloader**, a Windows YouTube video/audio downloader that’s beginner-friendly and fast.
